# Tools

## Data standards

### hOCR

*hOCR is a format for representing OCR output, including layout information, character confidences, bounding boxes, and style information.*

- **[hocr-tools](https://github.com/ocropus/hocr-tools)** Tools for the manipulation of hOCR files and the evaluation of OCR quality.

- **[hocrjs](https://github.com/kba/hocrjs)** - Visualization of hOCR files.

- **[PAGEviewer](https://www.primaresearch.org/tools/PAGEViewer)** - Visualization of page layout and OCR segmentation for PAGE XML, ALTO XML, FineReader XML and hOCR.

## Optical character recognition

- **[Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) OCR engine** - Open source C++ api and command line tool. Provides basic layout analysis.

- **[Ocrad](https://www.gnu.org/software/ocrad/)** - The GNU OCR.

## Document layout analysis, text enrichment and semantic segmentation

- **[layout-parser](https://github.com/Layout-Parser/layout-parser)** - Dectron2-based layout analysis tool.

- **[dhSegment](https://github.com/dhlab-epfl/dhSegment)**

## Quality evaluation

- **[Aletheia](https://www.primaresearch.org/tools/Aletheia)** - Ground truth annotation tool.

## Text analysis

- **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)** - Well-documented general purpose ML library.

- **[TidyText](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext)** - Manipulation of text data (R package; easy to do the same with pandas).

- **[LdaSeqModel](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldaseqmodel.html)** - Dynamic topic modeling in Python.
